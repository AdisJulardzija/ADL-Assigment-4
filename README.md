# ADL-Assignment-4

We have made an educational economic chatbot, with the use of CrewAI, FastAPI and Streamlit. CrewAI makes the backend and business layer (backend), while streamlit makes the presentation layer (frontend). The frontend and backend are connected through the API. The result is a chatbot that is able to explain economic terms, and make a knowledge graph with related terms to the query.
